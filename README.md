# Getting Started 
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`


# about the choice of the graphLibrary (https://apexcharts.com/) 
though the usual standard is react chart js 2, i found it hardly customisable and the doc for react is poor. A lot of plugins go all over to fill for the lacks of native features.
ApexCharts is a lot more intuitive and popularized enough to ensure maintenability over time.
